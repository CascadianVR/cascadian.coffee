        <p>
            Hello, nice to meet you! My name is Mason, but online I mainly just go by my username "Cascadian". Officially, I'm an engineer with a bachelor's in both Electrical and Computer Engineering. When I'm not working however, I love to do a lot more!
        </p>
        <p>
            I spend much of my free time learning many things such as 3D modeling, making tools, developing games, working on VR hardware/software, graphics engineering, and much more! It's my passion to keep learning new things and expanding my capabilities.
        </p>
